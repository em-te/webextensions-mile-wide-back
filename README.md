# WebExtension: Mile Wide Back

## Introduction
Quickly navigate back in the browser history by clicking on the left border of the window, navigate forward by right-clicking on it, middle-click on the left border to close the current tab, and rotate the mouse-wheel to cycle through your tabs.

## Description

Turns the left edge of your browser window into a multi-purpose button for controlling your browser and navigating your tabs.

* Left click to navigate back
* Right click to navigate forward
* Middle-click to close the current tab
* Left click and right click simultaneously to open a new blank tab
* Rotate the mouse wheel to cycle through your tabs

Using Fitts Law, you can fling your wrist to the left of the screen without accuracy or coordination to reach the multi-purpose button. You could even do this blind-folded.

Your window needs to be maximized to work.

## Advantages

Unlike typical mouse gesture extensions, this extension is more intuitive and faster to operate because it only requires one click. It does not require coordination between 2 fingers and it does not require the drag and drop gesture which requires 2 actions to be performed at the same time.

## Limitations

This extension only works when there is a webpage loaded in the current tab. That webpage also cannot be an internal webpage like the bookmarks manager, settings page, or a browser error page (like an SSL error page), because extensions are forbidden from interacting with those internal webpages. This extension needs access to the current webpage because it needs to detect clicks performed in the webpage area.
